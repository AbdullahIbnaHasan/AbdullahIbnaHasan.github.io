Hello,

I am Md Abdullah Evna Hasan, a veterinary microbiologist with a strong focus on antimicrobial resistance, nosocomial infections and emerging zoonotic threats. I completed my DVM (2018–2024) at <a href="https://bau.edu.bd/"> Bangladesh Agricultural University</a> and currently a MS FELLOW in Microbiology at the <a href="https://vmh.bau.edu.bd/"> Department of Microbiology and Hygiene </a>. Since April 2024, I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant in <a href="https://vmh.bau.edu.bd/profile/VMH1005"> Professor Dr. Md. Tanvir Rahman </a>’s Laboratory, where I investigate nosocomial and ESKAPE pathogens (*Enterococcus spp., *Escherichia coli, *Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae)* in veterinary environments including livestock, poultry, and surrounding ecosystems.

Through these experiences, I have built strong expertise in pathogen detection and molecular characterization, while cultivating a deep commitment to tackling the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. I am particularly driven to explore how resistant pathogens circulate across animals, humans, and the environment, and to translate this knowledge into One Health–based solutions. With curiosity, determination, and a collaborative spirit, my ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to global efforts against drug-resistant infections and the protection of public health.
